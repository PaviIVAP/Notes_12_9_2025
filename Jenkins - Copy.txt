Jenkins

Basics

What is Jenkins and why do we use it?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It automates building, testing, and deploying code.

What is a Jenkins job?

A Jenkins job is a task or a set of tasks configured in Jenkins, such as building or testing software.

What‚Äôs the difference between Freestyle and Pipeline jobs?

Freestyle: Created using the Jenkins UI, suited for simple tasks.

Pipeline: Defined using a Jenkinsfile, supports complex workflows using code.

How can you manually trigger a Jenkins job?

By clicking the "Build Now" button in the Jenkins UI.

What are build triggers in Jenkins?

Build triggers automatically start jobs based on events (e.g., SCM changes, scheduled time).

üìù Jenkinsfile / Pipeline

What is a Jenkinsfile?

A text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline and is stored in the source code repository.

What are the two types of pipelines in Jenkins?

Declarative Pipeline

Scripted Pipeline

What does the agent block do in a pipeline?

Specifies where the pipeline or stage will run (e.g., any available agent or a specific label).

Explain the difference between stages and steps in a Jenkinsfile.

stages define major phases (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).

steps define actions inside each stage (e.g., run commands).

What does bat 'javac HelloWorld.java' do in a Jenkinsfile?

Runs the Windows batch command to compile HelloWorld.java.

üîÅ Advanced Pipelines

What is a declarative pipeline vs scripted pipeline?

Declarative: Simple, structured syntax (pipeline {} block).

Scripted: Full control using Groovy scripting (node {} block).

How do you pass parameters to a Jenkins pipeline?

Use the parameters block inside the Jenkinsfile.

What is a post block used for?

Defines actions that run after the pipeline (e.g., always, success, failure).

What is the use of when in a pipeline?

Conditionally execute a stage based on environment, branch, etc.

What is the use of input step in a pipeline?

Pauses the pipeline and waits for manual approval.

üß∞ Multibranch & SCM

What is a multibranch pipeline?

Automatically creates jobs for each branch in a repo with a Jenkinsfile.

How does Jenkins detect new branches in a multibranch pipeline?

By scanning the repository using a timer or webhook.

What plugin is commonly used to integrate GitHub with Jenkins?

GitHub Integration Plugin or Git plugin.

What is Webhook in GitHub and how does it relate to Jenkins?

A webhook sends push notifications from GitHub to Jenkins to trigger jobs.

üõ†Ô∏è Build Tools & Execution

What is the difference between sh and bat in Jenkins?

sh: Used for Unix/Linux shell commands.

bat: Used for Windows batch commands.

Can Jenkins run jobs on multiple operating systems?

Yes, using different build agents (Windows, Linux, etc.).

How do you install Jenkins plugins?

Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available tab > Install.

What is a build agent? What is the purpose of a node?

A build agent runs Jenkins jobs. A node is any machine configured to run jobs.

How would you run a Java program in Jenkins?

Use bat 'javac HelloWorld.java' and then bat 'java HelloWorld' inside a pipeline.

‚öôÔ∏è Real-world Concepts

You have a repo with HelloWorld.java. Write a simple Jenkinsfile to compile and run it.

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                bat 'javac HelloWorld.java'
            }
        }
        stage('Run') {
            steps {
                bat 'java HelloWorld'
            }
        }
    }
}

How can you send email notifications after a build?

Configure Email Notification or Extended Email Plugin.

Use a post block with emailext command.

What are some common post-build actions?

Send email, archive artifacts, trigger another job, deploy, etc.

How would you use Jenkins to deploy a file to a remote server?

Use SCP, FTP, or SFTP in a post block or custom stage with sh/bat.

Example: sh 'scp file user@remote:/path'

pipeline practice:



pipeline{

  agent any


      parameters{
            Boolean(name:'DEPLOY_TO_PROD', defaultValue:'true', description:'Deploy if the value is true'
            
}

    stages{

         stage('Greet'){
            steps{
               echo "Hello, Jenkins!"
}
             }
           stage('Build'){
               echo "Compiling source code..."
             }
          stage('Deploy'){
            script{
              if(params.DEPLOY_TO_PROD){

             echo "Deploy to production"

}else{

echo "Skipping deployment"
}

}


}
  }                       
}
