ClusterIP ‚Äì Internal Microservice Communication
Scenario: You have a backend API and a frontend app running in the same cluster. The frontend needs to call the backend.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  type: ClusterIP
üß† Why: The frontend can reach the backend via http://backend-service without worrying about Pod IPs. No external exposure needed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ NodePort ‚Äì Quick External Access for Dev/Test
Scenario: You‚Äôre testing a new app and want to access it from your laptop without setting up a cloud load balancer.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: test-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: test
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30007
  type: NodePort
üß† Why: You can access the app at http://<NodeIP>:30007. Great for quick demos or internal tools.

3Ô∏è‚É£ LoadBalancer ‚Äì Public Access in Cloud
Scenario: You‚Äôre deploying a production-grade web app on AWS and want users to access it via a public IP.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prod-web
spec:
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
    - port: 443
      targetPort: 8443
  type: LoadBalancer
üß† Why: Kubernetes asks AWS to provision a public IP and load balancer. Users can access your app securely via HTTPS.

4Ô∏è‚É£ ExternalName ‚Äì Redirect to External API
Scenario: Your app needs to call a third-party payment API, but you want to abstract the DNS name.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: payment-api
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: api.stripe.com
üß† Why: Your app can call http://payment-api and Kubernetes will resolve it to api.stripe.com. Clean and centralized DNS management.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Headless Service ‚Äì Stateful Database Cluster
Scenario: You‚Äôre deploying a Cassandra database and each node needs to discover others directly.

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cassandra
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: cassandra
  ports:
    - port: 9042
üß† Why: DNS returns all Pod IPs. Cassandra nodes can connect directly to each other for replication and clustering.
