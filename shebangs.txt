while writing a shell script the line

#!/bin/bash is used "shebangs"or "hashbangs" tells the interpreter that it should use bash shell to
to execute script

normal example to run

vim hello.sh -----vim is an editor for linux which allows to write using the 
i -insert to write :W for savings :qw fo saving and exiting

chmod +x hello.sh------to make it executable

./hello.sh to execute


chmod +x helllo.sh ----changing mode to executable
chmod us used to chnage the permission of a file
w-write, r-read, x-execute
owener-u,group-g,others-o------permission categories
symbolic/octal mode (u,g,o,+,-,=,777,755)


eg

chmod u+x file.sh---ading execute permissionto owner 
chmod g-w removing write permission to the group
chmod a+r file.text  give read permissio ot all

octal mode:
4-read
2-write
1-execute

chmod 755 hello.text
here o 7 = read(4)+write(2)+execute(1)
g 5=read (4)+execute(1)


to see current permission
ls -l

-rwxr-xr--==
owner group others
r+w+e r+e    r


set -x  =enabling debugg mode  set +x disbaling debug mode

lets us sees the actual valueEvery command and its expanded form is visible in the output.
Using set -x shows the exact commands being executed, along with their expanded values as they are run in the script


jq is used to get spcific value so that the requireed data is got 

jq==used toprocess,parse,manipulate json data in linux environment
uses:
extract specifc elemenst from a json file
modify or reformat
pretty-rint
mapping,reducing,grouping json elements

it is a JSON parser used in linux

Reads JSON:Converts a JSON string into a data structure (like a dictionary, object, or list).
Validates JSON: Ensures the JSON syntax is correct (e.g., proper brackets, keys are quoted, etc.).
Extracts Data: Allows users to access specific values or modify data within the JSON structure.
Generates JSON: Many parsers also allow converting structured data back into JSON format.


ls -l==list long format means shows the detailed information along with the files and directories

Directories have a d at the beginning.
Regular files have a -.





mv file1 folder1/
: Move a File to a Sibling Directory (relative path)

If you're inside folderA and you want to move a file to folderB (which is at the same level as folderA), you can do this:

bash
Copy
Edit
mv file1 ../folderB/
No absolute path needed, just relative path (../folderB/).

shell/terminal

You type pwd (print working directory) in the terminal.
The shell interprets it, asks the OS for the current directory, and returns the result.
